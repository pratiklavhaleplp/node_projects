### Node Modules
- what is the difference between **modules and node modules?** Module is a single entity from where you export functions, objects, variables, etc. Node Module on other hand is a collection of modules.
- For using 3rd party libraries you need to first initialize your npm
    ```
    npm init -y     -> yes to all the init questions
    ```
- What is a **package**. A **package** is a reusable code that has been uploaded on npm registory.
- What is the use of **package-lock.json**? 
  - package-lock.json helps to tell the npm installer which exact version you need to install. You can get the exact details of npm package versions from this file. This file also helps you to install pacakages with same versions accross all the environments which helps to resolve dependencies.
  - **Faster installation** every time you don't need to query the npm reqistory to check which is the latest version and install the latest one. There might be scenarois that you need a specific version such specificity can be acheived with the help of package-lock.json.
  - One important point **The package-lock.json file is specific to your local development environment and is not meant to be shared**
