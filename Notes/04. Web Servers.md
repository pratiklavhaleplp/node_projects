- **Same Origin Policy** **Origin** is combination of three things

    What same origin policy says that you cannot make request to other origin if you are already on a specific origin. For example you are logged into facebook and through browser console window if you are making request to google.com then you will get the **CORS** error.
- **CORS** is called as cross origin resourse sharing. This header is always set on the resopnse and controled by the server who owns the data. Let's say you build a server and you want only specific origins to make request to you server at that time you can use this CORS headers.

    - Cors follows whitelisting policy. **WhiteListing** is the way through which you specify that abc.com or pqr.com are allowed to access your server. **Blacklisting** on other side specifies that all are allowed except adc.com, pqr.com
