### **Module System**
- We are not going to write code every time for oen particular thing **modules** helps us to reuse the code which has been written by other developers or your code which is going to get repeated again and again.
- There are three main reasons why we need to use modules they are.
    1. Helps to resuse your/ other code
    2. Only expose what is required not inner functionality is exposed
    3. Hels us to organize your code.
- **Creating Modules**
  - You can do this with the help of ```module.exports``` check ```node_projects\Notes\practice\03. Modules\callOperations.js.```
