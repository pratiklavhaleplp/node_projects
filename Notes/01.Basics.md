### **Node Basics**
- what is nodeJS? It's a SDK which will help you to run javascript code out side the browser and also it is capable of interacting you system with the help of **libUV** the library which has bindings ot your code to OS.

- **The Global Object** In **javascript(BROWSER)** we have location, history, navigate, window, documents,... like object available but in **node** you will have __fileName, require(),process, global,...
- **What Node does?** Node not just runs your javascript code outside browser but also helps you to read files, making http request, etc.. such tasks are handeled with the help of NodeJS's Api bindings which in turn calls libuv library which is being written into c language which helps node to read files, make http requests and other I/O tasks.

- **Asynchronous and Synchronous** Synchronous means executing in sequence and Asynchronoues is opposite to Synchronous which means that you code will jump from one part to another if there is a I/O is going to get performed. For example if you are listening music and also checking github repository.
- Node is ASYNC event driven javascript runtime.
- **JS is single threadded then how it handels ASYNCE functions?** It's the beauty of event loop. Event loop is a peice of code which executes your ASYNC code it is written in c and the implementation is in libuv. Event loop is actually a loop which keeps on running until all the execution in the process get's completed.
